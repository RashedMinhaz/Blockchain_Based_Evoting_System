# Voting System using Block-Chain

A user can cast his vote by visiting this web platform. For web server scripting we have used python based web framework **`Django`**.



## How to run

1. Make sure you are connected to the internet.
2. Install all the (pip) dependency packages (main packages are listed in `requirements.txt`).(pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Locate `EMAIL_ADDRESS` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` variable in `Election/settings.py` file and assign your valid credentials. (See [References](#EmailCredentials))
4. Make sure email sending is allowed (while development process sending email every time is not a good idea because API allows us to send email only for limited no. of times.).

5. Locate `manage.py` file and run `python manage.py runserver` in the same directory.

6. Locate the URL provided in the terminal and access that. by default it is [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
